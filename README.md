# ProPhET
ProPhET is a probabilistic programming tool able to estimate the measure of
phylogenetic signal generated by VERSO.

## Input
ProPhET takes in input the following files:
- **inference**: the VERSO step one output
- **clonal_variants**: the VERSO input
- **names**: exported names of rows and columns of the following objects:
    - B matrix
    - C matrix
    - corrected_genotypes
    - clonal_variants

## Output
The output of ProPhET is a real number $\delta$. An high value of $\delta$ means
that the phylogenetic signals are more informative. A low value of $\delta$ 
could suggest that a case of homoplasia could be present in the phylogenetic 
tree.
